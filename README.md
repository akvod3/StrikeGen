# StrikeGen
Character Generator for the Strike RPG.

Jim McGarva has given permission for the use of the names of backgrounds, origins, kits, kit advances, feats, 
classes and roles from the main book and expansions, and for implementation of their computable effects on a 
character (including relationships to other items by name), but *not* for reproduction of their full text.
