# StrikeGen
Character Generator for the Strike RPG.

Jim McGarva has given permission for the use of the names of backgrounds, origins, kits, kit advances, feats, 
classes and roles from the main book and expansions, and for implementation of their computable effects on a 
character (including relationships to other items by name), but *not* for reproduction of their full text.

Currently looks like ass because it runs inside the Elm Reactor which doesn't support stylesheets (!?). Will address this later.

Texts for backgrounds and origins are in the JSON data files. Classes, custom background, etc may not be - they'll just be 
in the code because trying to avoid that would inevitably end up creating an inner platform.
